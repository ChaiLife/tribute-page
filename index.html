            <p> The word <a href -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chai_(symbol)>Chai</a> is made up of two letters of the Hebrew alphabet - Chet (ח) and Yod (י), forming the word "chai", meaning "life", "alive", or "living". The most common spelling in Latin
                script is "Chai", but the word is occasionally also spelled "Hai". </p>
            <p>The Chai symbol makes a popular jewelry piece. It is believed to have luck-bearing and protective properties and is worn by men as well as women. It is also widely seen in paintings, sculptures, tapestries, and plaques.</p>
            <p> <a href - https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/what-is-chai/> Unlike the Indian tea chai</a>, which is pronounced with the “ch” sound of “chocolate,” the Hebrew chai is pronounced with the same “kh” sound as in challah. Both words rhyme
                with “high,” however. Chai also refers to the number 18. That’s because each Hebrew letter has a numerical equivalent, and the sum of chet (numerical value of 8) and yud (numerical value of 10) is 18. As a result of its connection to the
                word for life, the number 18 is considered a special number. </p>
